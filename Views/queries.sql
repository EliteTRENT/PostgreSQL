Q2 
`Simplifies complex queries by encapsulating them into a reusable object.
Enhances data security by restricting direct access to underlying tables.
Provides abstraction, shielding users from schema changes.`

Q3 update employee_salaries set salary = salary + 5000 where emp_id = 101;
UPDATE 0

Q4 
`Views cannot always be updated, especially if they include joins, aggregations, or complex logic.
Performance may be slower for views with complex queries as they execute each time they're queried.
Changes in underlying tables may require updating dependent views`

Q5 
`Restrict access to sensitive columns by exposing only necessary data through the view.
Use views to enforce row-level security by filtering data based on user roles or conditions.`

Q6 
`Store a frequently-used complex query in a view and reference it as a table in simpler queries.`

Q9 
`Simplifying reporting by encapsulating complex SQL logic.
Providing row or column-level access control for security.
Creating a stable interface for applications when the database schema evolves.
Aggregating data for dashboards or analytics.`

Q10 
`Data virtualization allows users to access and manipulate data from multiple sources as if it resides in a single database, without physically moving or copying it. 
Views in PostgreSQL can be used as a lightweight way to achieve data virtualization by abstracting the complexity of underlying data sources.`
